TIMS²Rescore User Guide
=======================

Introduction
------------

The `TIMS²Rescore` tool is a DDA-PASEF adapted version of `ms2rescore` that allows users to perform rescoring of peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) acquired on Bruker instruments. This guide provides an overview of how to use `timsrescore` in `ms2rescore` effectively.

Installation
------------

Before using `timsrescore`, ensure that you have `ms2rescore` installed on your system. You can install `ms2rescore` using the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install ms2rescore

Usage
-----

To use `timsrescore`, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your input files:
    - Ensure that you have the necessary input files, including the PSM file spectrum files
    - Make sure that the PSM file format from a supported search engine or a standard format like .mzid(:external+psm_utils:ref:`supported file formats <supported file formats>`).
    - Spectrum files can directly be given as .d or minitdf files from Bruker instruments or first converted to .mzML format.

2. Run `timsrescore`:
    - Open a terminal or command prompt.
    - Navigate to the directory where your input files are located.
    - Execute the following command:

      .. code-block:: bash

          timsrescore -p <path_to_psm_file> -s <path_to_spectrum_file> -o <path_to_output_file>

    Replace `<path_to_psm_file>`, `<path_to_tims_file>`, and `<path_to_output_file>` with the actual paths to your input and output files.
    _NOTE_ By default timsTOF specific models will be used for predictions. Optionally you can further configure settings through a configuration file. For more information on configuring `timsrescore`, refer to the :doc:`configuration` tab in the user guide.

3. Review the results:
    - Once the `timsrescore` process completes, you will find the rescoring results in the specified output file or if not specified in the same directory as the input files
    - If you want a detailed overview of the performance, you can either give the set `write_report` to `True` in the configuration file, use the `--write_report` option in the command line or run the following command:
  
      .. code-block:: bash

          ms2rescore-report <output_prefix>

    Replace `<output_prefix>` with the actual output prefix of the result files to the output file.

Additional Options
------------------

`ms2rescore` provides additional options to customize the `timsrescore` process. You can explore these options by running the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    timsrescore --help
